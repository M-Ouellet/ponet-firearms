This github repository provides the prep files to replicate the quantitative analysis in the paper entitled, 
"Firearms, peers, and policing: The role of informal networks on law enforcement gun use". The two prep files provide the code to:
1) Clean the data and replicate the descriptive tables in the paper; and
2) Estimate stochastic actor oriented models to assess whether officers' informal relationships shape their firearm behaviors.

Data for the study come from the Police Networks Project (PoNet), a study of officers' informal and workplace interactions. The data were obtained from a longitudinal network survey measuring formal officer relationships (e.g. same training class, same assignment) and informal officer relationships (e.g. friendship, mentor) within one police department in the United States. The survey data contain anonymized information on officersâ€™ self-reported work histories, relationships within the police department, misconduct histories, weapon use, attitudes toward policing, and demographics. Data for the study were collected
with voluntary participation.
